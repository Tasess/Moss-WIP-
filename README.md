# Wordpress Theme: Moss

This project is a Wordpress Theme built to be suitable for online portfolios to help people share their services, creations, or trade.

## Getting Started

Below are some simple instructions to get the theme fully functional on your local machine.

---
## Prerequisites

For development, you will need to have this running locally and have Wordpress installed on your computer with a local server running. You can do this by installing via [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/), or using [ServerPress](https://serverpress.com/).

## Node

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is easy to intall & includes NPM. If you're not sure if you have it, follow the procedure below to check.

Open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell, or a similar command line tool and run as an administrator. Type in the following line

```
node -v
```
If you have npm installed, you will see a version number appear. Repeat this step for NPM. 
```
NPM -v
```
Please ensure both are up to date.

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tasess/Moss-WIP-.git
$ cd Moss-WIP-
$ npm install bootstrap
```

## Sass

Sass is added along with the bootstrap. 

If you are new to Sass, you will need to compile scss to css in order for it to work. I recommend using [Koala](http://koala-app.com/), or use the command line. Follow the procedure below if you plan to compile with command line.
```
sass library/styles/moss.scss library/styles/moss.css
```
